GrandMail
=========

Convert emails to pieces of dead trees carried by the postal service to your elderly/luddite friends and family!!!

This uses SendGrid to turn emails into a post request, which is interpreted by our PHP script to call the Lob API which prints and sends the letter or postcard.

This uses Lob API, SendGrid, and DOMPDF.
